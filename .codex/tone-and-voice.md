# Voice & Tone

<Subtitle>Clarity, confidence, and technical precision</Subtitle>

Texture's writing style is confident, direct, and technically specific.  
Sentences should be short, declarative, and structured for scanning.

## Core Principles

- Lead with what the system **does**, not what it **is**.  
- Replace adjectives with **verbs**.  
- Avoid metaphors, hyperbole, and filler.

## Examples

| ‚úÖ Preferred | üö´ Avoid |
|--------------|-----------|
| "Connect and monitor DERs across customer sites." | "Easily revolutionize how you manage energy." |
| "The workflow runs automatically when telemetry updates." | "The workflow simply triggers when the data changes." |
| "Secure, event-driven coordination between assets." | "Next-generation platform for grid-edge innovation." |

## Voice Attributes

### Confident

State what the system does without hedging or over-explaining.

‚úÖ "The platform validates device credentials before establishing a connection."  
‚ùå "The platform can help validate device credentials in most cases."

### Plainspoken

Use clear, everyday language. Avoid buzzwords and marketing speak.

‚úÖ "Sync device telemetry to your data warehouse."  
‚ùå "Leverage cutting-edge pipelines to empower your data strategy."

### Structured

Organize information logically. Use lists, tables, and headers to break up dense text.

‚úÖ Use bullet points for benefits or steps.  
‚ùå Write long paragraphs with multiple ideas mixed together.

### Technical

Be precise about platform behavior, scopes, and constraints.

‚úÖ "This endpoint requires `devices:read` scope."  
‚ùå "You'll need the right permissions to access device data."

---

## Writing for Scanning

Most readers scan before they read. Help them by:
- Leading with the most important information
- Using descriptive headers
- Breaking up walls of text with lists
- Highlighting key terms in **bold**

---

## Active Voice

Use active voice to make actions clear.

‚úÖ "The system sends an alert when the device goes offline."  
‚ùå "An alert is sent when the device goes offline."

---

## Sentence Length

Keep sentences under 20 words when possible. Break complex ideas into multiple sentences.

‚úÖ "Events trigger workflows. Workflows execute actions based on conditions you define."  
‚ùå "Events trigger workflows that execute actions based on conditions you define in the platform."

---

## Avoid These Phrases

| üö´ Avoid | ‚úÖ Use Instead |
|----------|---------------|
| "Simply" | Remove it |
| "Just" | Remove it |
| "Easily" | Remove it |
| "Leverage" | "Use" |
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "Enable" | "Let you" or specific verb |
| "Empower" | Specific action verb |
| "Seamlessly" | Remove it |
| "Robust" | Specific capability |
| "Powerful" | Specific capability |

---

## Technical Specificity

When describing platform behavior:
- Name the exact object or resource
- State the trigger or condition
- Specify the result or output

‚úÖ "The `device.offline` event fires when a device hasn't reported telemetry for 15 minutes."  
‚ùå "Devices automatically trigger events when they're not working."

---

## Consistency

Use the same terms throughout the docs:
- **Device**, not asset, resource, or unit
- **Telemetry**, not data, metrics, or readings
- **Workflow**, not automation, flow, or rule
- **Scope**, not permission or access level
- **Organization**, not account, tenant, or company
