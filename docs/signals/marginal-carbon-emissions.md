# Marginal Carbon Emissions

Texture has entered a partnership with [WattTime](https://watttime.org/) to provide marginal carbon emissions data for your energy network.

We fetch marginal carbon emissions data from WattTime for each of the places where you have energy data. We then combine this data with the energy data to get a complete picture of your energy network. We also store this data in our database for future analysis.
