# Weather

We source weather data from various sources and combine it with the energy data from your devices to get a complete picture of your energy network.

Today we source weather data from the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). We are working on adding more sources.

When we get updated device data, we will ingest the weather data for that location and combine it with the energy data to get a complete picture of your energy network. We will also store that data in our database for future analysis so we will have a historical picture of what the weather was for that location.
