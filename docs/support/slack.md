# Texture Slack Community

We have a [Slack community you can join](https://join.slack.com/t/texture-community/shared_invite/zt-2ho02ds2o-pBNH1ZGcopxgIY3BgKcKzg) where you can ask questions, get help, and chat with other Texture users.

Not only are Texture engineers in that community and ready to help, but you also have the opportunity to chat with other developers who are using Texture and building cool things with it. This is a great place to get help, share your projects, and learn from others.

We'll also post updates there about releases of new features as we ship them and are happy to take bug reports and/or feature requests.
