# Destinations

While we do not always get data pushed to us in real-time, we do have the ability to push data to other systems in real-time as we get it on the Texture platform. This is done via Destinations.

## What is a Destination?
A Destination is a place where we can send data from the Texture Platform in real-time. This could be a third-party system, a data warehouse, or a custom API. We are continuing to add more and more destinations to the Texture Platform.

We have in-depth documentation on [Destinations](/docs/destinations/overview) in its own section but philosophically we want to be able to push data to you to avoid the need to pull data from us on some kind of schedule.
