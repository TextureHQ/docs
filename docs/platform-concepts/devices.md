# Devices

Devices are the physical or virtual objects that are connected to the platform. 

_Eventually, Texture wants every Device that produces, stores, or consumes energy to be on the Texture Platform._

To date, we have focused on Device types requested by our customers. If there is a Device type that you would like to see supported, please let us know!

## Device Types
Today we support a variety of device types including:
- Solar Inverters
- Electric Vehicles
- Electric Vehicle Chargers
- Batteries
- Smart Thermostats

We are constantly working to add support for more device types to the Texture Platform.

## Supported Devices
For the full list of supported devices, please see our [Supported Devices](/docs/sources/supported-devices) documentation.
