# Customers

_This page is a stub and will be updated soon. The Customers feature on Texture is in public beta and will be available for everyone soon. In the meantime if you are interested in helping us test the feature please let us know._

During onboarding, Texture will collect some Customer information as they connect a Device or a Utility account. From that we are able to build a Customer profile which link to the Site and we are able to use the energy data we are gathering to understand the Customer's energy usage and provide it to our users in our Dashboard and via API.

## Customer Profile

The Customer Profile consists of basic customer information that can be used for many applications including compliance and reporting. Generally it represents a person in the real world with a name, email address, and other information that can be used to identify them.

Part of the benefit and power of the Customer Profile is that it allows us to understand the energy usage of the Customer across multiple Sites. For example if one person has a primary residence and then a vacation home and they are both linked to the same Customer Profile, we are able to understand the energy usage of the Customer across both Sites.
