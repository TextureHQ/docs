# Destinations

import { Subtitle } from '@components/Subtitle';

<Subtitle>Automatically deliver energy data to your systems and applications</Subtitle>

**Destinations** enable automatic data delivery from the Texture platform to your preferred systems and applications. Instead of polling APIs or manual data retrieval, destinations push your energy data to the right place, in the right format, at the right timeâ€”ensuring seamless integration with your existing infrastructure.

## Why Destinations?

Modern energy applications require real-time data integration across multiple systems. Destinations solve critical integration challenges:

- **Eliminate Polling Overhead**: Automatic data delivery reduces API calls and infrastructure complexity
- **Enable Real-Time Operations**: Instant data delivery powers responsive energy management systems
- **Ensure Data Reliability**: Built-in retry logic and error handling guarantee delivery
- **Support Multiple Use Cases**: From real-time streaming to batch analytics and alert notifications
- **Simplify Integration**: Connect with existing systems without custom development

## Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multiple Formats** | JSON, CSV, or custom formats for different system requirements |
| **Flexible Scheduling** | Configure delivery frequency from real-time to daily batches |
| **Reliable Delivery** | Automatic retry logic and error handling for guaranteed delivery |
| **Event Filtering** | Specify exactly which data and events to receive |
| **Authentication** | Secure delivery with multiple authentication methods |

## Available Destinations

### Data Streaming

| Destination | Use Case | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **[Webhooks](/platform-concepts/destinations/webhooks)** | Real-time integration | HTTP POST requests to your endpoints with instant event delivery |
| **[Kafka](/platform-concepts/destinations/kafka)** | Event streaming | Stream data to Apache Kafka topics for distributed processing |

### Notifications

| Destination | Use Case | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **[Email](/platform-concepts/destinations/email)** | Alerts & reporting | Data summaries, alerts, and scheduled reports via email |
| **[SMS](/platform-concepts/destinations/sms)** | Critical alerts | Text message notifications for urgent events and system alerts |

:::tip Event Data
All destinations receive [Events](/platform-concepts/events) containing device telemetry, system alerts, and operational data. Configure event filters to control exactly which data each destination receives.

## Implementation Process

### Setup Steps

1. **Select Destination Type**: Choose from webhooks, Kafka, email, or SMS based on your integration needs
2. **Configure Endpoint**: Provide destination details (URLs, topics, addresses, phone numbers)
3. **Set Authentication**: Configure secure access credentials and authentication methods
4. **Define Event Filters**: Specify which events and data types to receive
5. **Test Delivery**: Validate configuration with test events before going live

### Configuration Examples

Each destination has specific setup requirements:

| Destination | Configuration Requirements |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Webhooks** | HTTP endpoint URL, authentication headers, retry parameters |
| **Kafka** | Broker addresses, topic names, partitioning strategy, serialization format |
| **Email** | Recipient addresses, email templates, delivery schedules |
| **SMS** | Phone numbers, message templates, alert thresholds |

:::note Testing Required
Always test destination configurations with sample data before enabling production traffic to ensure proper integration and data flow.

## Use Cases

### Real-Time Energy Management

- **System Integration**: Stream device events to existing energy management systems
- **Alert Processing**: Send critical alerts to on-call systems via webhooks or SMS
- **Dashboard Updates**: Push real-time data to custom dashboards and visualization tools

### Analytics and Reporting

- **Data Warehousing**: Batch export energy data to analytics platforms via scheduled email or Kafka
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated delivery of regulatory reports and utility submissions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regular email summaries of system performance and energy metrics

### Operational Applications

- **Incident Response**: SMS alerts for device failures and system anomalies
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Email notifications for scheduled maintenance and service requirements
- **Customer Communications**: Automated updates to customer-facing systems and portals

## Roadmap

## Best Practices

1. **Event Filtering**: Configure precise event filters to reduce noise and focus on relevant data
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic in your receiving systems
3. **Security**: Use authentication and encryption for all production destinations
4. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for destination health and delivery success rates
5. **Testing**: Thoroughly test configurations in staging before production deployment

## Next Steps

- Configure your first destination using our detailed guides: [Webhooks](/platform-concepts/destinations/webhooks), [Email](/platform-concepts/destinations/email), [SMS](/platform-concepts/destinations/sms), [Kafka](/platform-concepts/destinations/kafka)
- Learn about [Events](/platform-concepts/events) to understand the data you'll receive
- Explore [Commands](/platform-concepts/commands) for bidirectional system integration
- Review [Apps](/platform-concepts/apps) for additional data sources to include in your destinations
