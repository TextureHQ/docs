## Integration Approach

### Custom Configuration Required

Standards-based integrations are tailored to your specific requirements and integration needs:

- **Device-Specific Setup**: Configuration varies based on device types and communication requirements
- **System Integration**: Custom approach depending on utility and grid operator systems
- **Validation Process**: Comprehensive testing to ensure compliance and reliability
- **Dual Protocol Support**: IEEE 2030.5 and OpenADR 3.0 can operate simultaneously for different use cases

### Protocol Support

| Standard | Status | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **IEEE 2030.5** | ✓ Supported | Device communication and smart grid integration |
| **OpenADR 3.0** | ✓ Supported | Demand response and grid services participation |
| **OpenADR 2.x** | Not currently supported | Legacy demand response (feedback welcome) |

:::caution Custom Implementation
Standards integrations require bespoke setup and validation. Implementation timelines vary based on system complexity and integration requirements.
