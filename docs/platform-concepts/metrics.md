# Metrics
<Subtitle>Time-series energy data for analysis, monitoring, and insights</Subtitle>

**Metrics** in Texture are time-series data points that represent energy usage, production, storage, and environmental impact across your devices and sites. Each metric is organized into configurable time buckets—from 15-minute intervals to yearly aggregations—enabling both real-time monitoring and long-term trend analysis.

---

## Why Metrics?

Metrics enable you to:

- **Monitor Performance** — Track energy consumption, production, and storage in real-time
- **Analyze Trends** — Identify patterns across hours, days, weeks, or months
- **Calculate Emissions** — Measure environmental impact with CO2 data
- **Optimize Operations** — Use data-driven insights for energy management
- **Enable Automation** — Trigger workflows based on metric thresholds
- **Generate Reports** — Create dashboards and analytics for stakeholders

Metrics serve as the primary data source for energy intelligence across the Texture Platform.

## Available Metrics

Texture currently offers five core metrics that cover the essential aspects of energy systems:

| Metric | Description | Applicable Devices | Unit |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------|
| **Energy Consumption** | Energy consumed or used to charge a battery | Battery devices | Watt-hours (Wh) |
| **Energy Production** | Energy produced or discharged from a battery | Battery devices | Watt-hours (Wh) |
| **Energy Storage** | Average energy stored in a battery | Battery devices | Watt-hours (Wh) |
| **Energy Emissions** | CO2 emissions associated with energy usage | Battery and Inverter devices | Pounds of CO2 |
| **Energy Generation** | Energy generated by solar inverters | Inverter devices | Watt-hours (Wh) |

Each metric follows consistent data structures and API patterns, making them easy to integrate into your applications.

## Metric Types and Usage

### Energy Consumption

Energy Consumption measures the amount of energy consumed or used to charge a battery in watt-hours (Wh). This metric only applies to battery devices.

**Data Characteristics:**
- **Unit**: Watt-hours (Wh)
- **Time Domain**: Data may be sparse, as values are only present when the battery is charging
- **Aggregation**: Each time bucket contains the total energy consumed during that period

**API Reference:**
```http
GET /v1/metrics/consumption
```

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.texturehq.com/v1/metrics/consumption?filterDeviceId[]=device123&filterRangeAfter=2025-04-10T00:00:00Z&filterRangeBefore=2025-04-10T23:59:59Z&windowSize=HOUR',
  {
    headers: {****
      'texture-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
```

### Energy Production

Energy Production measures the amount of energy produced or discharged from a battery in watt-hours (Wh). This metric only applies to battery devices.

**Data Characteristics:**

### Response Format

All metric endpoints return data in a consistent format:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "ts": "2025-04-10T00:00:00.000Z",
      "v": 1234.56,
      "deviceId": "device123",
      "siteId": null,
      "customerId": null
    },
    // Additional time buckets...
  ],
  "meta": {
    "label": "energyConsumedWhr",
    "series": [
      "device123"
    ],
    "sparse": false,
    "unit": "WATT_HOURS",
    "displayUnit": "whr",
    "domainMeta": {
      "label": "time",
      "sparse": false,
      "rate": {
        "unit": "HOUR",
        "displayUnit": "h",
        "scaleFactor": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Time Windows and Aggregation

**Window Size Options:**
The `windowSize` parameter determines the granularity of the time buckets in the response:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `FIFTEEN_MINUTES` | 15-minute intervals |
| `HOUR` | Hourly intervals |
| `DAY` | Daily intervals |
| `WEEK` | Weekly intervals |
| `MONTH` | Monthly intervals |
| `YEAR` | Yearly intervals |

**Relative Time Ranges:**
You can use the `filterRangeRelative` parameter to specify a time range relative to the current time:

- `1h`: Last 1 hour
- `12h`: Last 12 hours
- `1d`: Last 1 day (default if no time range is specified)
- `7d`: Last 7 days
- `30d`: Last 30 days
- `90d`: Last 90 days
- `1y`: Last 1 year

**Data Aggregation:**
When requesting metrics with different window sizes, the data is aggregated as follows:

- **Sum Aggregation**: Consumption, Production, Emissions, Generation
- **Latest Value Aggregation**: Storage

For example, when requesting hourly data for a day, you'll receive 24 data points, each containing the appropriate aggregation for that hour.

**Grouping by Site:**
You can group metrics by site using the `groupBy=SITE` parameter along with `filterSiteId` to specify which sites you want data for. This is useful when you want to analyze metrics across multiple devices belonging to the same site.

:::tip
**Data Freshness**

Consumption, production, generation, and storage metrics are available with minimal latency. Emissions data relies on data sync jobs and may have some lag. For immediate device state changes, consider using the [Events API](/platform-concepts/events).

## Best Practices

- **Use the appropriate window size**: For high-resolution analysis, use smaller window sizes (e.g., `FIFTEEN_MINUTES` or `HOUR`). For trend analysis, use larger window sizes (e.g., `DAY`, `WEEK`, or `MONTH`).
- **Choose between absolute and relative time ranges**: Use `filterRangeAfter` and `filterRangeBefore` for precise time periods. Use `filterRangeRelative` for rolling time windows relative to now.
- **Optimize for sparse data**: Some metrics like Consumption and Production may have sparse data in time periods when the battery is not active. Your application should handle these gaps appropriately.
- **Group by site when appropriate**: When analyzing trends across multiple devices at the same site, use the `groupBy=SITE` parameter instead of making multiple device requests.
- **Cache responses when possible**: To improve application performance, consider caching responses for frequently accessed time ranges that don't change often (like historical data).
