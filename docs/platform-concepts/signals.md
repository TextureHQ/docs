# Signals
Signals are additional sources of data that we use to enrich and enhance source data. They are often used to provide additional context to the data and make it more useful.

Core to the Texture platform is that we

1. Take source data, such as device data, utility bills, meters, and monitors, etc.
2. We normalize this data and convert it to the standard Texture schema
3. We also model this data to create [Sites](./sites) and [Devices](./devices)
4. We then use signals to enrich this data

## Supported Signals

We currently support the following signals:

* [Weather](/platform-concepts/signals/weather)
* [Billing](/platform-concepts/signals/billing)
* [Marginal Carbon Emissions](/platform-concepts/signals/marginal-carbon-emissions)
