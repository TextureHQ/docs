# Billing

We support a few different energy meter billing providers on the Texture platform.

## Arcadia

Arcadia is a billing provider that we support via [their Plug product](https://www.arcadia.com/products/plug). 

We fetch billing data from Arcadia for each of the places where you have energy data. We then combine this data with the energy data to get a complete picture of your energy network. We also store this data in our database for future analysis.

Texture does not provide Arcadia access ourselves, you will need to add Arcadia as a billing provider in your Texture account and provide your Arcadia credentials.

If you are interested in billing data from Arcadia but do not currently have an account with them, we can help you get set up. Please contact us at [support@texturehq.com](mailto:support@texturehq.com)

## UtilityAPI

[UtilityAPI](https://utilityapi.com/) is another billing provider that we support. We fetch billing data from UtilityAPI for each of the places where you have energy data. We then combine this data with the energy data to get a complete picture of your energy network. We also store this data in our database for future analysis.

Texture does not provide UtilityAPI access ourselves, you will need to add UtilityAPI as a billing provider in your Texture account and provide your UtilityAPI credentials.

If you are interested in billing data from UtilityAPI but do not currently have an account with them, we can help you get set up. Please contact us at [support@texturehq.com](mailto:support@texturehq.com)
