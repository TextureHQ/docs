# Overview

Devices and device data are only one piece of a demand-side Energy Network.

In order for you to get a full picture of your network, to understand your customers, to report to utilities, to plan for demand response, to predict future energy consumption, to etc. we need to combine data from devices with data from other sources.

This is where "Signals" come in.

Signals are other sources of data that we can ingest into the Texture platform and seamlessly connect to demand-side energy data.

We currently support the following signals:

* [Weather](/platform-concepts/signals/weather)
* [Billing](/platform-concepts/signals/billing)
* [Marginal Carbon Emissions](/platform-concepts/signals/marginal-carbon-emissions)
