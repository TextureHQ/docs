# Events
<Subtitle>Real-time notifications for system changes and device activity</Subtitle>

**Events** are the core of Texture's power—the platform was built as an event-driven system from the ground up, unlike traditional data warehouses that only provide historical analysis. This event-driven architecture enables real-time responsiveness, immediate automation, and proactive energy management that static data systems simply cannot match.

Every change in your energy infrastructure—device connections, state updates, command executions, and system modifications—triggers events that flow through Texture's real-time processing engine. This gives you immediate visibility and control **over** your energy systems, enabling automated workflows and proactive monitoring that transform how you manage energy infrastructure.

Each event follows the [Standard Webhook Specification](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) for maximum compatibility with existing integrations. Events are delivered as JSON payloads with consistent structure, making them easy to process and integrate into your applications****.****

## Why Events?

Unlike traditional energy management systems that rely on periodic data polling and batch processing, Texture's event-driven architecture provides immediate responsiveness and real-time control. Events enable you to:

- **Monitor Real-Time Activity** — Get immediate notifications when devices connect, disconnect, or update
- **Track Command Execution** — Know when commands succeed or fail across your device fleet
- **Automate Workflows** — Trigger actions based on specific events and conditions
- **Maintain System Health** — Proactively identify and respond to device issues
- **Audit System Changes** — Keep a complete record of all platform activity
- **Integrate with External Systems** — Connect events to your existing tools and workflows
- **Enable Real-Time Control** — Respond instantly to grid conditions, price signals, or device states
- **Scale Automation** — Build complex, multi-device automation that traditional systems cannot support

Events transform static energy data into dynamic, actionable intelligence—making Texture fundamentally different from traditional data warehouses that can only tell you what happened yesterday.

## Event Structure

All events follow a consistent structure for easy processing:

- **JSON Format** — All events are delivered as JSON objects
- **Type Property** — Each event has a `type` property indicating the event category
- **Version Control** — Events include a `version` property using semantic versioning
- **Unique Keys** — Every event has a unique `key` property for deduplication
- **Standard Webhooks** — Compatible with the Standard Webhook Specification

This consistent structure ensures reliable event processing and integration across your systems.

## Available Event Types

Texture currently offers eight core event types that cover the essential aspects of energy system monitoring:

| Event Type | Description | Trigger |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **customer.created** | New customer created on the platform | Customer registration |
| **command.failed** | Command execution failed | Command failure |
| **command.succeeded** | Command execution succeeded | Command completion |
| **device.discovered** | New device connected to platform | Device connection |
| **device.updated** | Device data updated | Device state change |
| **device.disconnected** | Device disconnected from platform | Device disconnection |
| **enrollment.approved** | Program enrollment approved | Enrollment approval |
| **site.created** | New site created on platform | Site creation |

Each event type provides specific data relevant to its context, enabling targeted automation and monitoring.

## Event Types and Payloads

### Customer Created

Fired whenever a customer is created on the Texture platform.

<CustomerCreatedEvent />

### Command Failed

Fired whenever a command run against a device fails.

<CommandFailedEvent />

### Command Succeeded

Fired whenever a command run against a device succeeds.

<CommandSucceededEvent />

### Device Discovered

Fired when a new device is connected to the Texture platform.

<DeviceDiscoveredEvent />

:::tip
**Device Type Filtering**

When configuring a destination, you can specify which device types should trigger events for a given destination. For example, you could configure a webhook to receive only Battery device updates, and Texture will filter events accordingly.
:::

### Device Updated

Fired whenever we get updated data for a device.

<DeviceUpdatedEvent />

:::note
**Device-Specific State Data**

The `state` object varies by device type. For example, a battery will have different state data than an inverter. See our [Data Models documentation](/platform-concepts/data-models/overview) for detailed information about device-specific state structures.
:::

Most device update events are triggered from device state updates, which typically occur on 5 or 15-minute intervals. We're continuously working to provide tighter interval telemetry data and enhanced filtering capabilities.

### Device Disconnected

Fired whenever a device disconnects from the Texture platform.

<DeviceDisconnectedEvent />

### Enrollment Approved

Fired whenever an enrollment is approved.

:::caution
**Grid Services Required**

This event is only available for organizations that have opted in to Grid Services. If you're interested in Grid Services, please reach out to our team.
:::

<EnrollmentApprovedEvent />

### Site Created

Fired whenever a site is created on the Texture platform.

<SiteCreatedEvent />

## Event Processing and Integration

### Webhook Delivery

Events are delivered via webhooks to your configured destinations. Each destination can be configured with:

- **Event Type Filters** — Specify which event types to receive
- **Device Type Filters** — Filter events by specific device types
- **Custom Headers** — Add authentication or custom headers
- **Retry Logic** — Automatic retry for failed deliveries

:::caution
**Webhook Reliability**

Ensure your webhook endpoints are highly available and respond quickly (within 10 seconds). Texture will retry failed deliveries, but persistent failures may result in event loss. Monitor your webhook health in the Dashboard.
:::

### Event Deduplication

Each event includes a unique `key` property that's a hash of the event data. This enables:

- **Duplicate Detection** — Avoid processing the same event multiple times
- **Reliable Processing** — Ensure idempotent event handling
- **Audit Trail** — Maintain complete event history

### Integration Patterns

Common integration patterns include:

- **Real-Time Dashboards** — Display live system status and activity
- **Automated Alerts** — Trigger notifications for critical events
- **Workflow Automation** — Execute actions based on event triggers
- **Data Synchronization** — Keep external systems updated with platform changes

---

## Best Practices

- **Handle Event Ordering** — Events may arrive out of order; design your handlers accordingly

:::tip
**Event Ordering Strategy**

Use the event `timestamp` field for ordering when sequence matters. For critical workflows, consider implementing a simple queue or using the event `key` for deduplication to ensure reliable processing.
:::
- **Implement Idempotency** — Use the event `key` to prevent duplicate processing
- **Monitor Webhook Health** — Track delivery success rates and response times
- **Plan for Event Volume** — Design your systems to handle expected event frequency
- **Test Event Handling** — Validate your event processing logic with test events
- **Monitor Event Latency** — Track time from event occurrence to processing

---

## Next Steps

- **Configure Destinations** — Set up webhook endpoints to receive events
- **Implement Event Handlers** — Build logic to process and respond to events
- **Monitor Event Activity** — Use the Dashboard to track event delivery and processing
- **Explore Advanced Filtering** — Configure device-specific and event-type filtering

Events provide the real-time foundation for monitoring, automation, and integration across your energy infrastructure in Texture.

:::note
**Expanding Event Types**

We're continually adding more event types as we build out the Texture platform. If there's an event type you'd like to see, please let us know!
