# Events

_We are continually adding more event types as we build out the Texture platform so if there is an event type you would like to see, please let us know._

First some overall notes on the event types:

We follow the [Standard Webhook Specification](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) as closely as possible for maximum compatibility with existing webhook integrations.

- All events are sent to the destination as a JSON object.
- All events have a `type` property that indicates the type of event.
- All events have a `version` property that indicates the version of the event type. We use semver for versioning.
- All events have a `key` property that is a unique identifier for the event. The `key` is a hash of the event data and is used to deduplicate events helping you avoid duplicate events.

## `customer.created`

Fired whenever a customer is created on the Texture platform.

<CustomerCreatedEvent />

## `command.failed`

Fired whenever a command run against a device fails.

<CommandFailedEvent />

## `command.succeeded`

Fired whenever a command run against a device succeeds.
<CommandSucceededEvent />

## `device.discovered`

Fired when a new device is connected to the Texture platform. Includes the following payload:

<DeviceDiscoveredEvent />

_Note that when you configure a destination, you can specify which device types are fired for a given destination which can act as a kind of filter. So for example you could say that you want only Battery updates to go to a given webhook and we will filter them for you._

## `device.updated`

Fired whenever we get updated data for a device.

<DeviceUpdatedEvent />

Note, the `state` object will differ by device type. For example, a battery will have different state data than an inverter. We have details on these differences [here](/platform-concepts/data-models/overview). The above example is for a battery.

The lion's share of these events will be triggered from the Device state updates which we get mostly on 5 or 15 minute intervals from the devices, however we are always looking to get tighter interval telemetry data as well as allow for specifying filters on that data. Stay tuned as we continue to add richer functionality to the filtering data to these events.

## `device.disconnected`

Fired whenever a device disconnects from the Texture platform.

<DeviceDisconnectedEvent />

## `enrollment.approved`

Fired whenever an enrollment is approved.

> This event is only available for organizations that have opted 
in to Grid Services. If you are interested in Grid Services, please reach out to us.

<EnrollmentApprovedEvent />

## `site.created`

Fired whenever a site is created on the Texture platform.

<SiteCreatedEvent />
