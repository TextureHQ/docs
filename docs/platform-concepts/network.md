# Network

The Texture Platform is designed to manage Energy Networks. An Energy Network is a grouping of energy assets that can communicate with each other to form a network.

This is the best way to truly unlock the power of energy resources. By bringing these assets online into an Energy Network, you can monitor, control, and communicate with them via the Texture Platform.

## What is an Energy Network?
An Energy Network is a network of energy assets that can communicate with each other to form a network.

We have seen a huge proliferation of energy assets in the last decade with the velocity of those deployments continuing to accelerate. However, these assets are often not in a state where they are able to communicate with each other. This means that the ability to control or monitor them remotely is limited.

With Texture, you are able to unlock the true power of those devices by bringing them online and into an Energy Network, which will allow those devices to interoperate. You are able to view those devices in the Texture Dashboard and control them via the Texture API.
