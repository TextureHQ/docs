# Virtual Power Plants

## What is a Virtual Power Plant (VPP)?

A **Virtual Power Plant (VPP)** is a network of decentralized, medium-scale power generating units, flexible power consumers, and storage systems that are aggregated and operated as a single entity. Unlike traditional power plants, VPPs are distributed across multiple locations but can be remotely and collectively controlled.

VPPs typically include:
- **Energy Resources (ERs)** such as solar panels and wind turbines
- **Energy Storage Systems** like batteries
- **Flexible Loads** that can adjust their energy consumption on demand
- **Electric Vehicles** and their charging infrastructure

By intelligently coordinating these diverse assets, VPPs can:
- Provide grid services like frequency regulation and peak shaving
- Participate in energy markets and demand response programs
- Optimize energy usage and generation based on price signals
- Enhance grid resilience and stability

## VPPs on Texture

Many VPP operators build and run their networks on the Texture platform, leveraging our device control capabilities, real-time data processing, and extensive integration options.

### Core VPP Capabilities

Texture provides the following capabilities essential for VPP operations:

1. **Device Connectivity**: Direct integration with a wide range of energy assets, including solar inverters, battery systems, EV chargers, and smart thermostats
2. **Real-Time Control**: Secure, reliable command dispatch to individual devices or groups of devices
3. **Telemetry**: Continuous monitoring of device status, power output, and energy consumption
4. **Aggregation**: Logical grouping of devices by location, type, or other criteria for coordinated control
5. **Automation**: Rule-based and algorithmic control based on time, price signals, or other triggers
6. **Visibility**: Comprehensive dashboards and reporting for monitoring VPP performance

### Market Access and Program Management

While Texture provides the foundational technology for operating VPPs, many operators also need specialized capabilities for market access and program management. For these needs, Texture integrates with specialized partners:

#### Leap Energy Integration

Through the [Leap Energy](/integrations/apps/leap) App, VPP operators can:
- Access multiple demand response programs and energy markets
- Receive dispatches and automatically translate them to device commands
- Submit enrollment information and track participation
- Handle settlements and performance reporting

#### Shadow Power Integration

The [Shadow Power](/integrations/apps/shadowPower) App enables VPP operators to:
- Monetize behind-the-meter flexibility
- Access wholesale energy markets
- Optimize asset dispatch based on market conditions
- Manage financial settlements

### Getting Started with VPPs on Texture

Whether you're looking to build a new VPP or migrate an existing one to a more robust platform, Texture provides the technology foundation you need.
