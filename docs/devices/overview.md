# Overview

The Texture Platform makes it easy to connect to your Energy Devices once a device has been [connected](/docs/sources/overview) to our platform.

Once a connection has been established, we will retrieve device information from the manufacturer and make it available via our APIs and SDKs.

We will also start actively monitoring a device, either by subscribing to real-time updates from the manufacturer (if they support them) or by polling.

See more details on what information you can pull for devices in our detailed sections.
