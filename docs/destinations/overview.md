# Overview

Destinations allow you to specify where and when to receive your data.

You can specify how you receive it and what to receive where. You can configure as many Destinations as you'd like so you are always in control of where your data lands.

This was one of the first things we built on the Texture Platform. 

We wanted to make it easy for you to get your data where you want it, when you want it.

Without Destinations, you would have to write a lot of custom code to get your data to the right place and in the right format and you have to waste a bunch of resources polling us for data.

With Destinations, you can configure your data to go to the right place and in the right format and you can configure it to be sent to you when you want it.

Currently supported destinations:

- [Webhooks](./webhooks.md)
- [Email](./email.md)
- [SMS](./sms.md)
- [Kafka](./kafka.md)
