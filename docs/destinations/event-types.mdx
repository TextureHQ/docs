# Event Types

_We are continually adding more event types as we build out the Texture platform so if there is an event type you would like to see, please let us know._

First some overall notes on the event types:

We follow the [Standard Webhook Specification](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) as closely as possible for maximum compatibility with existing webhook integrations.

- All events are sent to the destination as a JSON object.
- All events have a `type` property that indicates the type of event.
- All events have a `version` property that indicates the version of the event type. We use semver for versioning.
- All events have a `key` property that is a unique identifier for the event. The `key` is a hash of the event data and is used to deduplicate events helping you avoid duplicate events.


## `command.failed`

Fired whenever a command run against a device fails.

<CommandFailedEvent />

## `command.succeeded`

Fired whenever a command run against a device succeeds.

```js title="Command Succeeded Event"
{
    "type": "command.succeeded",
    "version": "0.0.2",

}
```


| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| type | The type of event, in this case `device.updated` |
| version | The version of the event type, following semver |
| key | A unique identifier for the event, essentially a hash of the event data |
| timestamp | The date and time when the event occurred |
| data.deviceId | The unique identifier for the device, created by Texture when the device was discovered |
| data.deviceModel | The model of the device |
| data.deviceName | The name given to the device, usually by the customer in their manufacturer app |
| data.manufacturer | The manufacturer of the device |
| data.deviceType | The type of device (e.g., battery) |
| data.workspaceId | The ID of the workspace associated with the device |
| data.organizationId | The ID of the organization associated with the device |
| data.customer.referenceId | A reference ID for the customer, whatever was supplied by your organization during the device enrollment process |
| data.state | An object containing the current state of the device |
| data.state.id | The unique identifier for this state update |
| data.state.charge | The current charge of the device in Wh (watt-hours) |
| data.state.chargePercentage | The current charge percentage of the device |
| data.state.chargingState | The current charging state of the device |
| data.state.whConsumed | The amount of energy consumed in Wh (watt-hours) |

| data.state.isStormModeEnabled | Whether storm mode is enabled |
| data.state.isStormModeActive | Whether storm mode is currently active |
| data.state.createdAt | The timestamp when this state update occurred (which may be different than the event timestamp if the state was batched and sent slightly delayed which is the case for some OEMs) |
| data.createdAt | The timestamp when this update was created. This is the timestamp of the request the OEM's API returned, not necessarly the timestamp of when the state was actually updated on the device. For that see `data.state.createdAt` |

Note, the `state` object will differ by device type. For example, a battery will have different state data than an inverter. We have details on these differences [here](/docs/devices/data-models/overview). The above example is for a battery.

The lion's share of these events will be triggered from the Device state updates which we get mostly on 5 or 15 minute intervals from the devices, however we are always looking to get tighter interval telemetry data as well as allow for specifying filters on that data. Stay tuned as we continue to add richer functionality to the filtering data to these events.

## `device.disconnected`

Fired whenever a device disconnects from the Texture platform.

```js title="Device Disconnected Event"
{
    "type": "device.disconnected",
    "version": "0.0.1",
