- **Vehicle Integration**: Connect with electric vehicles for V2G capabilities

### Solar Equipment
- **Solar Panels**: Monitor solar panel performance and output
- **Solar Inverters**: Manage solar energy conversion systems

## Integration Process

### 1. Device Discovery
Texture automatically discovers compatible devices on your network or through manufacturer APIs.

### 2. Authentication
Connect your device accounts using OAuth or API keys as required by the manufacturer.

### 3. Configuration
Set up device-specific parameters and preferences for optimal performance.

### 4. Monitoring
Once connected, you can monitor device status, performance, and control capabilities through the Texture dashboard.

## Device Management

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track device performance and status
- **Remote Control**: Send commands to devices when supported
- **Data Collection**: Gather historical performance data
- **Alerts**: Set up notifications for device events and issues

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for device integrations:

- **Connection Issues**: Check network connectivity and authentication
- **Data Sync Problems**: Verify API permissions and rate limits
- **Control Limitations**: Some devices may have restricted control capabilities
