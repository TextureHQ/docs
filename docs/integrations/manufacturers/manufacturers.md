# Supported Manufacturers

Texture works with the following manufacturers to provide integrations for their devices. We work directly with manufacturers to build OEM Partnership APIs with well-documented access to device capabilities.

## Our Integration Approach

**We never use web scraping or reverse engineering in any of our device integrations.**

We work directly with manufacturers or partners to build OEM Partnership APIs with well-documented access to device capabilities. These partnerships include contractual SLAs and dedicated communication channels for support.

Reverse-engineered APIs are unstable, undocumented, and prone to break at any time. They create high maintenance overhead, introduce major security and compliance risks (often requiring storage of sensitive user credentials), and are limited to only what a user could do in an app's interface.

Our approach ensures the reliability, security, and long-term viability of our platform. This strategic decision enables more sophisticated integrations and provides an enterprise-grade foundation for the entire energy ecosystem.

For a more detailed explanation of why we take this approach, read our blog post: [Why Texture Doesn't Reverse Engineer APIs and Why That Matters](https://www.texturehq.com/blog/why-texture-doesnt-reverse-engineer-apis-and-why-that-matters).
