# Supported Devices

Currently, Texture supports the following types of devices and models.

If you are a Customer with a request, please 
[submit here](https://texture.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/3/create/13).

If you are a manufacturer and would like to see your devices supported on the Texture 
platform, please [let us know](https://www.texturehq.com/contact-us).

## A note on our integration quality

**We never use web scraping or reverse engineering in any of our device integrations.**

We work directly with manufacturers or partners to build OEM Partnership APIs with well-documented access to device capabilities. These partnerships include contractual SLAs and dedicated communication channels for support.

Reverse-engineered APIs are unstable, undocumented, and prone to break at any time. They create high maintenance overhead, introduce major security and compliance risks (often requiring storage of sensitive user credentials), and are limited to only what a user could do in an app's interface.

Our approach ensures the reliability, security, and long-term viability of our platform. This strategic decision enables more sophisticated integrations and provides an enterprise-grade foundation for the entire energy ecosystem.

For a more detailed explanation of why we take this approach, read our blog post: [Why Texture Doesn't Reverse Engineer APIs and Why That Matters](https://www.texturehq.com/blog/why-texture-doesnt-reverse-engineer-apis-and-why-that-matters).

## Our vision

Our vision is to have every device that produces, consumes, or stores energy connected 
to the Texture platform. We are working hard to make that a reality and are always 
looking for new devices to support. Currently, our prioritization is driven mostly by 
the volume of customer requests for new devices, so if there is one you would like to 
see supported, please let us know.

We hope that one day the device integration/connection is a commodity as more and more 
manufacturers adopt open standards and APIs. Our focus can then be on the value add on 
top of that data with our real-time ETL, rather than the plumbing to get it there.

Our integrations are a means to an end, not the end itself for the Texture platform. 
You will see this from all of the other features we have built and are building, much 
of which is outlined in great detail on these docs.

I share this only to make clear that Texture is not just another device integration company. 
We are an Energy Data Platform focused on much more than just the integration. With that 
said, below is a list of the devices we currently support.

### Coming soon

| Device type  |
| :----------- |
| Heat pump    |
| Water heater |

> ðŸ¤” FAQ: Will you support X device type?
> 
> Possibly! Texture is focused on Energy devices, so if a device you're looking for is not an Energy device, then it is unlikely. We are not a generic iot platform, though we can point you in the direction of some great ones.
> 
> If you are looking for a specific Energy device though then absolutely, we would love to support it. We are always adding support for additional manufacturers devices and there may be new Device types we haven't incorporated into our platform that are relevant. If you know of one, [let us know!](https://texture.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/3/create/13)
