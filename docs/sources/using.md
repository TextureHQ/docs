# Using

Once a Device is connected to the Texture Platform, you can start to interact with it via the Texture API. No other action is required on your part!

We will automatically start to collect data from the Device by polling and make it available to you via the Texture API.

We will also manage the Device's connection to the Texture Platform, including refreshing the OAuth token when it expires automatically so you never have to worry about that.

This is some of the magic of the Texture Platform. We take care of the hard parts so you can focus on building your application and providing value to your customers.
