# Overview

Connections are the ways that devices get connected to the Texture Platform so that their energy usage can be monitored and controlled.

Today we have 2 main types of connections:

1. End User Connections
2. Installer Connections

## End User Connections

End user connections are the connections that are made by end users to their devices. 

These are generally our customers' customers that are homeowners who own solar panels, electric vehicles, or batteries and want to connect them to the Texture Platform.

Texture provides a variety of ways for these end users to connect their devices to the Texture Platform including:
1. Creating a Connect link via our REST API
2. Creating a Connect link via the Texture Dashboard
3. Creating a Connect link via one of our SDKs
    1. Texture JavaScript SDK
    2. Texture React SDK
    3. Texture React Native SDK

And we are constantly working to make it easier for our developers and customers to enable their end users to connect their devices to the Texture Platform so if there is an SDK or a method that you would like to see, please let us know.

## Installer Connections

These are generally connections made by installers who are installing devices on behalf of end users.

They often have credentials to connect to devices directly via the manufacturer and then connect them to the Texture Platform.

We support installer credentials for a variety of our supported manufacturers and are constantly working to add more. Most of the docs in this section focus on End User Connections but if you are an installer and need help connecting a device, please reach out to us and we can help you get connected.
