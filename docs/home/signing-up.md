# Signing Up
 
## Step 1: Create your account

[Register your account](https://dashboard.texturehq.com/sign-up) with a company or entity specific email address. We strongly recommend avoiding the use of personal email addresses. This helps us create a more secure experience and support associating you with your Organization.

## Step 2: Verify your email

To ensure that you are not a bad actor, please check your inbox and verify your email address before creating or joining an organization.

Add a profile picture or change your preferences any time in the Settings tab

## Step 4: Create an Organization

> All new users are given a default Personal organization. This is a great place to create multiple test [Workspaces](/docs/platform-concepts/workspaces), but is not intended to house Company information or production data. We recommend creating or joining a Company organization for production.

On the Texture platform, an Organization is generally a company or some other kind of entity that you work for and which has other Members from your team on it.

To create a new Organization, click your avatar and + Create organization. Visit the Settings > Organization anytime to make adjustments.

You will be asked a series of questions to set your Company preferences.

## Step 5: Create a workspace

Within your Organization you will create specific Workspaces to manage different environments. These workspaces will also house your specific Server (Private) and Connect (Public) API keys.

For example, you might have a Workspace for production, staging, and development. Or you may have a Workspace for each member of your team, so everyone can have their own sandbox.

To create a new Workspace, navigate to the Dashboard and find the `+ Add workspace`. Name your Workspace whatever you'd like then click Create. You'll see the new Workspace populate on the menu. You can use the dropdown menu to navigate between the various Workspaces.

## Step 6: Invite your team

Adding your team to Texture will be important for full energy network visibility. You can add team members from the Dashboard through the Invite a Member button or from Settings > Organization > Members 

From this page, you will see a button to Invite Team Member. Simply add their company issued email address that matches your Organization and click Invite.

The invited member will receive an email with instructions to set up their account.
